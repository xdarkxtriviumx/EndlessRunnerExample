# EndlessRunnerExample
## Overview
The project shows how you can hook up various systems together for making a game in Unity. This should server as a starting point to get some ideas for how to do things. As it is currently designed, you keep playing until you collide with an enemy, at which point the character will be destroyed and a 3 second timer will run. After the timer ends the scene reloads and the whole process starts again. High score is updated when the player hits an enemy.
## Controls
* `[A]` / `[D]`: Move the player left or right to avoid the enemies.
* `[Z]`: Transition the camera between a normal and zoomed out view. (Seeing how things happen outside of the player's POV)
* `[Space]`: Pause/unpause the game.
## Pause Menu Info
You can quit the game using the `Quit` button (if you're playing a built version of the game). You can also view or reset the high score on the top-left of the pause screen.
